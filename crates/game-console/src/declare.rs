//! The release's declaring tables, written in the notation - `P-443`, answering `C-97`.
//!
//! **Rule 7 puts the game's data in the specification**: *state the game's data in several
//! files in a directory of their own, in the notation rather than in a table*. This is what
//! one of those files says, generated from the release so that the transcription is checked
//! rather than trusted - which is what `S-110` asked for first and what makes Sean's *go with
//! the data we have been using* a verifiable sentence.
//!
//! **`P-443` is what made it writable at all.** `C-97` asked whether a notation whose every
//! word is *a kind, a trait, or one of a trait's values* can carry a **declaration** - a file
//! that says which kinds there are is not a state of a game. The answer was that it needs no
//! second form: `kind`, `trait` and `family` are themselves kinds, so `{kind name:citizen}` is
//! an ordinary description and [`crate::state::declarations`] reads it with the one parser.
//!
//! # One table, and why not yet the other seven
//!
//! **`Kinds` is here because `P-443` wrote the example**, and nothing about its shape is this
//! lane's invention: a row is a name, and the name is the whole of what the notation carries.
//! The *What it is* column stays where rule 7 puts it - *relationships in prose* - so this
//! file is the vocabulary and the sentences remain sentences.
//!
//! **`Families` and `Traits` declare too and are not here**, because each has a cell holding
//! **several values** - a family's members, a trait's `Of` and `Values` - and the notation
//! gives one value to a key. Whether that is several lines, a joined name, or something else
//! is a decision rather than work, and it is filed rather than guessed at.
